# 3degree_RRR_robot_in_matlab_genetic_algorithm
this project have used peter corke robotics toolbox for stimulating a RRR robot.this code has two calculating buttons in its gui for forward kinematics and two buttons for inverse kinematics.in calculating inverse kinematics one button use robotics toolbox and another button use genetic_algorithm
